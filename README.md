## üéØ The Problem

In today's world, consumers want to make sustainable choices, but they face a significant **information gap**. Product labels are often vague or misleading ("greenwashing"), and even official ratings like an "Eco-Score" don't explain the *why* behind the grade. This lack of transparency makes it nearly impossible for the average person to practice responsible consumption, directly hindering the progress of **UN Sustainable Development Goal 12**.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

**EcoScan** is a mobile-first web application that bridges this gap. By scanning a product's barcode, users get an immediate, easy-to-understand, and actionable sustainability report.

Instead of just a single score, we provide a detailed **Sustainability Breakdown** across three key pillars:

1.  **üì¶ Packaging Analysis:** Is the packaging recyclable? Is it made from problematic materials like plastic?
2.  **üåç Ingredient Origins:** Are the ingredients sourced locally, or do they have a large transportation footprint? Is the origin known at all?
3.  **üèÜ Production Method:** Does the product carry meaningful certifications like Organic or Fair Trade that ensure ethical and sustainable practices?

EcoScan empowers consumers to make informed decisions at the exact moment they are needed most‚Äîin the store aisle.
